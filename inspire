        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes are someone that we strive to be.</p>
        <p>Seth Rogan, although not the most influential of people, is who comes to mind when I think of who has inspired me throuout my life. He has been in many movies I watched growing up and has never failed to make me laugh. Although he grew up having some small rolls he has never given up on who he wants to be. </p>
